```{r}
a <- 2

```{r}
32+a
```
物件用一對反頓點就可以使用特殊自圓了，但叫出來時記得加上去
```{r}
`3b`<-55
```

```{r}
56-`3b`
```

數字後面加L會讓電腦判斷該數字確實為整數，否則電腦會在該數後面加.000000
```{r}
`c`<-32L
```



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
